        <p>Continuing my research into classical algorithms for working with logics, I ported <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Craig_interpolation">propositional interpolation</a> from Isabelle to SSReflect: <a href="https://github.com/clayrat/resolution-ssr/blob/main/theories/craig_interp.v">craig_interp.v</a>.</p>
<p>The interpolation property was introduced by William Craig in 1957 - a logical system has it if, for any two formulas <code>A</code> and <code>B</code>, such that the validity of the latter follows from the validity of the former, it is possible to find an “intermediate” formula <code>I</code> whose validity follows from the validity of <code>A</code> and entails the validity of <code>B</code>; at the same time, all variables in it occur in both original formulas (i.e., in general one cannot just take <code>A</code> or <code>B</code> as <code>I</code>). This property was further shown for many logics - propositional, first-order, a number of modal and multi-sorted ones, etc., often by constructive methods, which allows us to realize the procedure of finding <code>I</code> as an algorithm. Later, a number of results on the complexity of the interpolation procedure were also obtained, in particular the connection with the P=NP problem. In the 2000s, McMillan proposed the <a href="https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~alanmi/courses/2008_290A/papers/mcmillan_cav03.pdf">use of interpolation</a> to quickly approximate invariants in SAT-solving based model checkers. For more details, see the slides in <a href="https://logic.berkeley.edu/colloquium/DSilvaSlides.pdf">D’Silva, [2016] “Interpolation: Theory and Applications”</a>.</p>
