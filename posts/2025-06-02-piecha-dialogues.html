<p>This article presents three lectures on the dialogical semantics of intuitionistic logic. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dialogical_logic">Dialogical logic</a> is an interpretation of logical formulas devised by Paul Lorenzen and his student/collaborator Kuno Lorenz in the 1950s. It is based on the idea of a game between a player and an opponent, where the validity of a formula is determined by the player being able to form a winning strategy against any opponent’s behavior. In fact, it is a precursor to game semantics.</p>
<p>The lectures are organized as follows:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Introduction to Lorenzen’s dialogues for propositional logic: formulas, attacks/defenses, positions, D-dialogues, strategies, completeness, and classical generalizations.</li>
<li>Extension of propositional logic to Horn clauses in the style of logic programming: E-dialogues, Prolog-style definitional reasoning (resolution + unification).</li>
<li>An alternative interpretation of implication and the corresponding new form of E-dialogues, introducing additional asymmetry between the permissible moves of the player and the opponent.</li>
</ol>
