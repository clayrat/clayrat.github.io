        <p>On November 3, I gave a talk named “Programming and Proving with Guarded Recursion” at <a href="https://persons.iis.nsk.su/en/PSSVfrom2022towards2023">the PSSV’23 workshop</a> on a topic I’ve been working intensively on for the last couple of months - <a href="https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/guarded+recursion">guarded recursion</a>. I’ll make a short synopsis here; more details are found in <a href="http://clayrat.github.io/talks/2023-PSSV-guarded-recursion.pdf">the slides</a> and the <a href="https://github.com/clayrat/guarded-cm/">GitHub repo</a>.</p>
<p>Briefly, the idea of guarded recursion can be characterized as the calculus of thunks; it goes back to modal <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Provability_logic">logics of provability</a> (Gödel-Löb system and similar ones). In the guarded type system, the deferred computation returning A is denoted as <code>▷A</code>. This type constructor is equipped with the structure of an applicative functor, i.e., as basic operations, we can defer the computation for one step (<code>next : A → ▷A</code>) and apply a function to an argument at the next step (<code>ap : ▷(A → B) → ▷A → ▷B</code>). The main working construction, however, is the (unique) guarded fixed point operator <code>fix : (▷A → A) → A</code>. From a programmer’s point of view, it behaves like a recursion that returns control to the caller after each iteration, which allows total algorithms to be written in a productive form, i.e., as potentially infinite series of terminating computations that can be interrupted after each step. Potentially infinite computations are ubiquitous in practice - they are all sorts of server-side programs and streaming data transformations.</p>
<p>Classical structures that can be defined using guarded recursion are:</p>
<ul>
<li>infinite streams</li>
<li>co-lists (i.e., sequences that can be both finite and infinite)</li>
<li>extended Peano numbers (where we have a term denoting ∞)</li>
<li>the so-called partiality monad (i.e., some value whose acquisition is delayed for an indefinite number of steps, from 0 to ∞)</li>
</ul>
<p>Applications of deferred recursion can be conceptually divided into two classes: working with infinite structures directly and encoding non-strictly positive recursive types. As a representative of the first class, we can refer to the definition and verification of <a href="https://github.com/clayrat/guarded-cm/blob/main/src/Guarded/ReplaceMin.agda">Bird’s replaceMin algorithm</a> and its further generalizations to MonadFix / value recursion. Non-strictly positive definitions can be demonstrated by the example of <a href="https://github.com/clayrat/guarded-cm/blob/main/src/Guarded/Hofmann.agda">Hofmann’s algorithm for breadth-first tree traversal</a>; in general, such constructions (+ the partiality monad mentioned above) often come up when working with models of PLs by the method of logical relations and constructing denotational semantics. These ideas are the basis of a young branch of PLT called <a href="https://www.jonmsterling.com/jms-005S.xml">(synthetic) guarded domain theory</a>, where any type is simultaneously a domain - this allows the work to be simplified considerably, eliminating numerous proofs of “domainness”.</p>
<p>It is worth noting that using the guarded modality alone severely restricts the possibility of manipulating thunks. On the one hand, such a ubiquitous type-based control is convenient. Classical approaches to dealing with infinite structures in proof-assistants, such as coinductive mechanisms, suffer from a lack of compositionality - since productivity checking used in them works syntactically, this regularly leads to a situation where the proof-engineer receives an error about a violation of totality only after the completion of a time-consuming proof, which, of course, is quite demoralizing. On the other hand, the coinductive reasoning cannot be entirely reproduced using guards - intuitively, when working with a deferred computation, we can only maintain or increase the degree of its “deferral”; in other words, thunks can never be “collapsed” at the design stage. This limitation can be circumvented by extending the system with special <a href="https://bentnib.org/productive.pdf">clock variables</a>, quantification by them (a particular case of this idea is the so-called “constant” modality), and the <code>force</code> primitive, which allows us to dynamically run chunks of deferred computation in contexts safe for this purpose.</p>
